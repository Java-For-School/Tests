א:
The return value of: sod1(a, 8, a.length -1) would be false.

The aim of the program is to determine whether an element of the array has the values of x. 

The time complexity of the program sod1 is O(n), as it iterates once over each element of the array. n == a.length.

ב:
The return value of: sod2(a, 16, a.length, - 1) would be true;

The purpose of the program is to determine whether the sum of two elements of the given array a, would amount to the number x

The time complexity of the program sod2 would be o(n^2), with n being the equivelent of the length of the array.

The program iterates over the array once using sod1, and a section time using sod2.
