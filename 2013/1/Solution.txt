sod1: The runtime-complexity of the function sod1 may be calculated as follows:
The function includes one singular loop which is repeated precisely 4 times regardless of the size of the input, earning it a runtime-complexity of O(1).

sod2: The runtime-complexity of the function sod2 may be calculated as follows:
The function includes one singular loop which is dependant on the input's size, earning it a runtime-complexity of O(N), with N being the size of the input.

sod3: 
The runtime-complexity of the function sod3 may be calculated as follows:
The function includes two loops, one of which is nested in the other.
Both loops are dependant on the input's size, earning sod3 the runtime-complexity of O(N*M) = O(N^2).
