An appropriate call would be: karamba(1, b, 0, 2);

#3 

The function returns the sum of all elements of the array that are between e and s, and are greater than k

#4

The function is called N times, with N being dependant on the size of the input, and runs at a runtime-complexity of O(1), which earns it the total runtime-complexity of O(N).
