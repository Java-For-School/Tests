The function consists of two loops; one nested within the other. The first loop is dependant on the input's size (num) earning the function a runtime-complexity of O(N), with N being num, the inside of that loop there resides a call to a function which in its turn iterates over the inputs once more, earning the inner part of the outer loop a runtime-complexity of O(N), with N being the length of the list. The above earns the function a total runtime-complexity of O(N*N) = O(N^2).
