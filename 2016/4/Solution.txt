The runtime complexity of the sort method is to be calculated in the following way:

Firstly, all rings attached to the pole are removed and placed in either of two other poles in correspondence to their size; ("L" or "S").
The above code block is ran at a runtime complexity of O(N) as it is dependent on the length of the input.
Then secondly, all rings are removed from the pole destined to hold "L" sized rings and returned to the original pole. The aforementioned actions are once more ran at a runtime complexity of O(N) as they are dependent on the size of the input.
Lastly, all rings are removed from the pole determined to hold "S" sized rings and returned back to the original pole. The aforementioned actions are once more ran at a runtime complexity of O(N) as they are dependent on the size of the input.
